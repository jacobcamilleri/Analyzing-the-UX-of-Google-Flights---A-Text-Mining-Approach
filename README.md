**Abstract**

The goal of this exploratory study was to assess the role of Google Flights as an effective and usable flight booking search service. In order to come up with actionable insights, text mining (word frequencies, topic modelling and sentiment analysis) was conducted on 3 user needs assessments and 3 think-aloud usability tests. The following is an overview of the findings:

**1. Word Frequencies**

  - Unigram: The most common word from the transcripts was ‘like’. In our case, the word was mostly used as a filler. The cognitive function for ‘like’ applies to hesitation;      users tried to make sense of Google Flight’s complex information architecture and were at a loss of what to say about the system. 

  - Bigram: ‘Google flight’ was prominently featured as a bigram. Apart from reiterating Google Flights for clarity when reading task descriptions, PPT01 and PPT02 made comparisons between Google Flights, Skyscanner and the newly-discovered Google Explore. In that context, users found Google Flights to be less appealing and expressed a preference to explore organically.

  - Trigram: ‘Coming seven days’ was the most popular trigram. PPT03 reiterated the word-level trigram for clarity when browsing through the calendar during date selection in Task 1. Overall, users found the the evaluation of flight prices in the date picker to be a positive UX attribute in this study. 

**2. Topic Modelling**

The top-30 most salient terms for Topic 1 can be interpreted as the following pain points:

  - Finding a trade-off between flight price and times in a complex system
  - Outbound and inbound flight selection as a 2-page design

**3. Sentiment Analysis**

To further identify the main pain points of this study, sentiment analysis was conducted to zone in on the statements with negative sentiment scores. Consistent with the topic modelling results, outbound and inbound flight presentation as a 2-page format was the most frustrating experience when completing flight bookings. Furthermore, date picker required user confirmation in order to saved selected dates, which was confusing for PPT03. In one instance, the participant selected her preferred dates and the calendar abruptly reverted to its original format when she clicked outside the box.
